# Volunteer Code of Conduct & Agreement

## Purpose

To inform volunteers on the standards of conduct required. Volunteers are expected to act honestly, conscientiously, reasonably and in good faith at all times when carrying out their duties, as well as in their relationships or interactions with other people, including customers, staff and other volunteers.

## Volunteers must:

### Be responsible

Be punctual, reliable, communicative, and dressed appropriately

### Respect customers

Our guests are diverse. Some may be experiencing food insecurity, homelessness, or other challenges. Our restaurants are founded on principles of inclusion and equality - it is essential that every guest feels welcome, and as comfortable as possible. If you have any concerns about any specific guests, let the restaurant manager know as soon as possible.

### Respect other volunteers

Our volunteers have a hugely diverse range of experience and skills. Some may have never worked in a restaurant environment before, or may not be confident in a new environment. It's important to maintain a positive attitude and be supportive of your fellow volunteers. It is also important to behave appropriately and responsibly, just as you would in any other workplace. If you have any concerns about any volunteers behaving disrespectfully or irresponsibly, please talk to your manager asap.

### Respect staff

Our team are experienced hospitality professionals, trained in the unique model of Everybody Eats. Please always follow their instructions. Please respect their professional boundaries; our restaurants are often close-knit communities, but our staff may choose not to spend time with volunteers outside of work.

### Be safe & hygienic

Make sure to read our Health & Safety policy. Follow all workplace safety and hygiene rules and procedures.

### Work hard

Pitch in, help others out, ask what needs doing.

### Be warm & welcoming

Smile, be polite. Be nice to others and they will be nice to you. No matter how unhappy someone looks, start by smiling and making them feel comfortable.

### Be fair

Act in a fair, honest and proper way. Create and maintain good relationships.

### Not discriminate in any way

Not by age, colour, disability, employment status, ethical belief, ethnic or national origin, family status, marital status, political opinion, race, religious belief, gender, or sexual orientation.

### Not accept any payment

For legal reasons, as a volunteer, you are not able to accept any financial reward for your work. Be courteous when not accepting gifts or gratuity from guests.

### Communicate openly

We welcome feedback. If you have any concerns or feedback about any aspect of Everybody Eats, please feel free to bring it up with our team. If there is something that you would prefer not to speak to your direct manager about, please get in touch with the General Manager (details at the end of this document).

## VOLUNTEER AGREEMENT

The purpose of this agreement is to provide clarity between you and us about the work you do here.

By signing up to volunteer with Everybody Eats you agree to the following:

### 1. No payment for volunteer work

I understand that I am engaged as a volunteer and not an employee of Everybody Eats. I will not be paid for any work performed and/or services provided to Everybody Eats.

### 2. Training and support

Everybody Eats will provide me with a briefing document about my role, which I agree to read before my first shift. Everybody Eats will also provide a basic induction on my first shift. If I require further direction or assistance, I will speak with the shift manager or General Manager.

### 3. Hours and absenteeism

Everybody Eats will provide me with advance notice of my volunteer times and days. If I need to cancel my shift, I will do so by the designated means of communication (the volunteer app), and with as much notice as possible. I understand that this will leave a gap in the roster. If canceling on the day of the shift, I will advise the shift manager directly via text message.

### 4. Standard of conduct

I agree to treat patrons of Everybody Eats, other volunteers, staff, and managers with courtesy and respect at all times. I agree to abide by the above Volunteer Code of Conduct at all times.

### 5. Resolving problems or concerns

If any problem or issue arises in the course of my volunteer work with Everybody Eats, I will first attempt to resolve this by raising my concerns with the shift manager. If the matter remains unresolved to my satisfaction, I will then raise my concerns with the General Manager or a member of the Everybody Eats Trust Board (whose details are available on the Everybody Eats website).

### 6. Confidentiality

In the course of my volunteer work with Everybody Eats I may have access to confidential information. I agree to maintain the confidentiality of that information, and will not at any time disclose this information to any other person or organisation.

### 7. Health and Safety

I have read and understood the Health & Safety Policy. I agree to comply with all health and safety rules and procedures, and to take all reasonable care for my own health and safety and the health and safety of others at work. I will report any hazards to Everybody Eats as soon as is practicable so that appropriate action may be taken.

### 8. Termination

I agree this agreement can be terminated by either party at any time for any reason without prior notice.

### 9. Photographs

I understand that Everybody Eats and those promoting Everybody Eats may take photographs of me during work. I agree that Everybody Eats may use my photographs on social media, print media, and any advertising, without paying me any compensation.

### 10. Communication

I agree to Everybody Eats adding me to their volunteer email database and communicating with me via email. Emails provide news updates and information about volunteering, updates from our partners and from time-to-time exclusive volunteer offers.
