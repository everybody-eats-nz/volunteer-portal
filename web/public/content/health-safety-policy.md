# Health & Safety Information

Because you will be working with or around food, we need to share some basic food safety information with you. Here are some tips and information recommended by MPI:

- Kill 90% of bugs by washing your hands properly. Wet, rub for 20 secs, rinse then dry.
- A Cellphone has 18x more bugs than a public toilet. Keep your phones away from food, preparation areas and equipment, and wash hands after use.
- If serving food, someone has made the food you serve safe for your customers – it's your job to continue to keep it safe by: washing hands regularly, keeping surfaces clean, being allergy aware, not working if sick and keeping pests out.
- Seperate Food and use separate chopping boards, equipment and prep stations to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Allergies.** The head chef on the day will be responsible for knowing the allergens in each specific dish. Even small traces of allergens have the potential to kill. There are 11 main allrgens: peanuts, shelllfish, dairy, eggs, fish, sesame seeds, sulphites, gluten, tree nuts, soy beans, lupins.
- Cook and store potentially hazardous food at the right temp to stop bugs growing. Ask the head chef for how to cook and store food properly.
- You must not handle food if you've had symptoms of vomitting or diarrhoea within 48 hours of your shift. If you have please notify us and we will need to cancel your shift.

The restaurant is a safe environment to work in, however there are a number of hazards to be aware of:

- Hot liquids, utensils, and fire
- Wet floors
- Heavy lifting
- Sharp objects

To ensure the safety of all in the workplace these hazards need to be identified and prevented by means of isolation and/or elimination to avoid the following risks:

- Burns and Scalds
- Slips, Trips, and Falls
- Strains, Sprains and other injuries
- Cuts and scrapes

Some guidelines to ensure you minimize these risks:

## Hot liquids, Utensils, and Fire / Burns and Scalds

- Stand to the side when opening hot ovens and steamers, and lift pan lids away from you to avoid getting burnt by the steam or hot air escaping.
- Carefully and slowly put food into hot oil to minimise the chance of oil splashing onto skin
- Always wear shoes that cover the tops of your feet to protect from splashes and spills.
- Avoid moving hot containers across walkways.
- Only clean ovens, fryers and cooking utensils when they have cooled.
- Store containers with hot contents on flat, stable surfaces.
- Check that pots and pans are in good condition and that handles are secure.
- Avoid placing hot containers on the floor.
- Avoid letting pan handles overlap the edge of the oven or work surfaces where they can be knocked off.
- Never use wet cloths to lift and move items.

## Wet Floors / Slips, Trips, and Falls

- Mop up any spills and warn others of the area. Place warning signage on wet area.
- Keep all work areas tidy and remove any objects that may be tripped over.
- Alert others when transferring loads and when behind someone.
- Please ask for assistance when using a step or ladder to reach something high.
- Always use adequate lighting when in dark areas and stairwells. Use handrails.
- **DO NOT RUN**

## Heavy lifting / Strains, Sprains and other injuries

When manually lifting an object, carry out the following procedure:

- Assess the load.
- Stand close to the load, centered over it and with feet set shoulder width apart for balance.
- Bend your hips and knees, but keep your back straight.
- Firmly grasp the object with both hands to keep the load balanced.
- Keep the load close to your body.
- Raise your head to look ahead.
- Straighten your legs and make sure your back also remains straight.

### Do not lift:

- with a rounded back
- while bent from the waist
- with feet close together
- with a tense or arched neck
- if the load is too heavy for you
- with an unbalanced load.

According to guidelines, the maximum weight you can lift will depend on; your gender, the distance of the load from your body and the height of the load. If you are male, and hold the weight close to your body at around waist height, the suggested maximum weight is 25kg. For anything heavier, or any load you are not comfortable with please ask for assistance. If you are female, and hold the weight close to your body at around waist height, the guidelines suggest that the maximum weight you should lift is 16kg. These are only guidelines so please do not attempt to lift anything more than what you feel comfortable with.

## Sharp Objects / Cuts and Scrapes

### Broken glass

From time to time glass will be broken. Please do not attempt clean this up with your hands. Use a dustpan and brush and dispose of glass into a cardboard box, not directly into the rubbish bin.

### Knives and prep equipment

We use sharp knives, slicers and other pieces of kitchen equipment that could injure you or others. Do not point knives at people. Carry knives pointing down by your leg with the blade facing inwards. Please be careful when using knives to cut things, keep your fingers clear at all times. If you are not sure how to cut something safely, please ask a member of staff or lead volunteer for help.

## Evacuation and Fire

Our fire exits are well lit, but please familiarise yourself with them prior to your first shift. In the event of a fire or the need for an evacuation, please direct customers towards these exits before exiting yourself. There are fire alarms and extinguishers located throughout the building. The evacuation plan and assembly point will be outlined in the volunteer briefing.

## If you are burned or scalded

### Remove the heat source

If any clothing is wet with hot liquid or affected by a chemical splash, remove it quickly and carefully. Remove any tight clothing, watches, rings or jewellery from the injured area, if possible, because of the risk of swelling.

### Cool the injured area

Immediately cool the affected area for at least 15 minutes using cool running water from a tap or shower. In the absence of water any cool clean fluid (beer, soft drink, etc.) can be used.

A first aid burn gel may be used in place of water, provided there is enough to cover the burn. You must to wrap the burn with a bandage once gel has been applied.

If you are badly injured, or the burn is causing significant pain, or involves the eyes, or is larger than half your arm – stop working immediately, inform the Manager on duty and seek medical attention or call **111** for an ambulance. See a doctor if the burn is causing ongoing significant pain, or involves the face, hands, joints or genitals.

You must report any of the above incidents to the Manager on duty.
