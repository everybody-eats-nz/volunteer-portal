The Admin Dashboard is your central command center for managing the volunteer portal. It provides real-time insights into volunteer activity, shift scheduling, and system performance across all locations.

## Dashboard Layout

### Statistics Overview
The dashboard displays four key metric cards:

1. **Total Users** - Shows volunteer count vs. admin count
2. **Total Shifts** - Displays upcoming vs. completed shifts  
3. **Total Signups** - Tracks confirmed, pending, and waitlisted signups
4. **This Month** - Highlights current month activity and new user registrations
