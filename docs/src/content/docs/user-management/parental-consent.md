# Parental Consent Management

Handle parental consent requirements for volunteers under 18 years old, including approval workflows and compliance tracking.

## Overview

The system automatically identifies volunteers under 18 and requires parental consent before they can participate in shifts.

### Consent Workflow

1. **Automatic Detection** - System identifies underage users during registration
2. **Consent Form Generation** - PDF forms available for download
3. **Admin Review** - Submitted consent forms reviewed by administrators
4. **Approval Process** - Admin approval enables shift participation

## Managing Consent Requests

### Accessing Consent Management
- Navigate to `/admin/parental-consent`
- Click **"Parental Consent"** in the admin sidebar
- View pending and approved consent requests

### Approval Process
